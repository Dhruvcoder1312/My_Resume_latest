                   <p> Hello! I'm Dhruv Bhasin, a B.Tech student specializing in Chemical Science and Technology at IIT Guwahati. I have a strong passion for data analysis, problem-solving, and consulting. My experiences as a Business Data Analyst Intern at Wipro and a Product Development and Strategy Intern at Raizz have equipped me with valuable skills in data visualization and competitive analysis.

                    In addition to my academic pursuits, I hold several leadership positions, including Branch Representative for my department, Product Manager for the Students Web Committee, and Events Head for SPIRIT'24. I am also a core team member at Finance and Economics club where I guide sophomores in finance and business analysis.
                    
                    I am deeply interested in consulting and product strategy, and I am excited about opportunities that allow me to enhance my skills and leadership experience to drive impactful results.
